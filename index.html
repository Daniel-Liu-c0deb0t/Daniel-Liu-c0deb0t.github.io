				<h2>about</h2>
				
				<p>
					I am a <b>high school student at Torrey Pines High School</b> that is interested in computer science. I will be a <b>freshman at the University of California Los Angeles</b> very soon!
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I like to make my code go very, very <b>fast</b>. Anything from high-level algorithms to low-level micro-optimizations is fair game for me.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I support the <b>open science</b> and <b>open source software</b> movements. I would not have been able to do any projects without them.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I've had two main research interests so far: <b>applying efficient string algorithms to bioinformatics problems</b>, and <b>evaluating the security of deep learning systems</b>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I've also done lots of programming projects in machine learning, programming languages, game development, etc. I like to reside in the niche between computer science theory and real-life practicality. I write Rust, Java, and Python with Vim on Linux.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>I blog about research and programming <a href = "https://blog.liudaniel.com/">here</a>.</b> If you are a high school student and you are wondering how to get into research, then I highly recommend checking out my post <a href = "https://blog.liudaniel.com/high-school-research-opportunities">here</a>.

				<h3>competitive_programming</h3>
				<p>
					I have template implementations of some commonly used algorithms for programming competitions, <a href = "https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/General-Algorithms/tree/master/general_algorithms">here</a>.
				</p>
				
				<h3>programming_languages</h3>
				<p>
					I am fluent in Java and Python. I know some C/C++, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
				</p>
				
				<h3>what_i_use</h3>
				<p>
					I previously used Eclipse for Java, PyCharm for Python, and later a complicated Visual Studio Code setup for Java, Python, and LaTeX, on a Windows computer. Currently, I use a simple Vim setup in VirtualBox, running Xubuntu (XFCE + Ubuntu), with a heavily customized look for most of my programming. I use Overleaf for writing LaTeX documents, Wordpress for blogging, and GitHub Pages for hosting this website.
