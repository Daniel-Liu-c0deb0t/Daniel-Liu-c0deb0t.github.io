				<h2>/about/</h2>
				
				<p>
					I am a <b>high school student at Torrey Pines High School</b> that is interested in computer science.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Currently, I have two main research interests: <b>applying string algorithms and data structures to bioinformatics problems</b>, and <b>evaluating the security and adversarial robustness of deep learning systems</b>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I also have other projects in machine learning, programming languages, and game development. I am generally interested in almost any computer science topic, and <b>I enjoy solving problems related to computer science and algorithms</b>. I find applying algorithms to real-life problems very interesting.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>I blog about research and programming <a href = "https://blog.liudaniel.com/">here</a>.</b>

				<h3>_competitive_programming_</h3>
				<p>
					I have template implementations of some commonly used algorithms for programming competitions, <a href = "https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/General-Algorithms/tree/master/general_algorithms">here</a>.
				</p>
				
				<h3>_programming_languages_</h3>
				<p>
					I am fluent in Java and Python. I know some C/C++, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
				</p>
				
				<h3>_what_i_use_</h3>
				<p>
					I previously used Eclipse for Java, PyCharm for Python, and later a complicated Visual Studio Code setup for Java, Python, and LaTeX, on a Windows computer. Currently, I use a simple Vim setup in VirtualBox, running Xubuntu (XFCE + Ubuntu), with a heavily customized look for most of my programming. I use Overleaf for writing LaTeX documents, Wordpress for blogging, and GitHub Pages for hosting this website.
