                    👋🏼 hey hey!
                </p>

					I'm a first-year CS student @ UCLA and a software dev supporting two cute ELFIN CubeSats 🛰️ in space.

                    My fav activity is writing high-performance Rust, though I've also worked with C/C++, Java, and Python. Currently, I'm thinking about SIMD parallelism and embedded systems, but in the past I've taken an interest in
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>time- and space-efficient algorithms for comp bio 🧬</li>
                    <li>adversarial attacks and defenses against 3D point cloud neural networks 🤖</li>
                </ul>

                    Previously, I interned @ 10x Genomics, creating a new spliced short read aligner. I also did research @ OpenMined and UCSD, so I've authored multiple published papers, contributed to open source, given talks, and helped review conf/journal papers. In the far past, I've built a programming language, made games, and sold software. I was platinum rank in USACO, a Regeneron STS scholar, and an Apple WWDC scholar.

                    Sometimes, I <a href = "https://blog.liudaniel.com/">blog</a> about CS. For high school students who are interested in research, I have a <a href = "https://blog.liudaniel.com/high-school-research-opportunities">list</a> of opportunities I wish I'd known about when I started.
