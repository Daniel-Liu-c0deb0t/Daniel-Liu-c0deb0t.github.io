                </p>

				<p>
					I'm a 4rd year undergrad CS boi @ UCLA. I like making algorithms go brrr and using them to process biological data (DNA/RNA/protein sequences).
				</p>

				<p>
                    Sometimes, I <a href = "https://blog.liudaniel.com/">blog</a> about CS. For high school students who are interested in research, I have a <a href = "https://blog.liudaniel.com/high-school-research-opportunities">list</a> of opportunities I wish I'd known about when I started.

                <p>
                    Here are some stuff I'm doing right now:

                    Here are some stuff I've done in the past:
                </p>

                <ul>
                <li>I've consulted for the startup Exai Bio.</li>

                <li>I've worked with Martin Steinegger @ Seoul National University on Block Aligner, a new SIMD-accelerated alignment algorithm in Rust. I was supported by the Emergent Ventures grant.</li>

                <li>I've worked as a student researcher on the DeepConsensus project in the genomics team @ Google. DeepConsensus is used in PacBio's Revio sequencing machines to produce accurate DNA reads using deep learning!</li>

                <li>I've worked a little bit with UCLA's ELFIN team on CubeSat flight software.</li>

                <li>I've interned @ 10x Genomics's computational biology team.</li>

                <li><a href = "https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu">uwu</a></li>

                <li>I've worked with Hao Su and Ronald Yu @ UC San Diego on the adversarial robustness of 3D point cloud deep learning.</li>

                <li>I've worked with Abraham Palmer and Jianjun Gao @ UC San Diego on efficiently preprocessing sequenced DNA reads. I was part of the REHU program funded by NIH.</li>

                <li>I was platinum rank in USACO, a Regeneron STS scholar, and an Apple WWDC scholar.</li>
                </ul>
