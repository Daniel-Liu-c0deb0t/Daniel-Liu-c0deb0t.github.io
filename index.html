                    👋 hey hey!
                </p>

				<p>
					I'm a first-year CS student @ UCLA and a software dev supporting two cute ELFIN CubeSats 🛰️ in space.
				</p>
				
                <p>
					My fav activity is building high-performance algorithms in Rust, C++, Java, or Python for bio 🧬, deep learning 🤖, and security 🔒. Currently, I'm thinking 💭 about SIMD parallelism.
				</p>

                <p>
                    Previously, I did research @ OpenMined and UCSD, so I've authored multiple published papers and contributed to open source. I've also given talks and helped review conf/journal papers. In the far past, I've built a programming language, made games, and sold software. I was platinum rank in USACO, a Regeneron STS scholar, and an Apple WWDC scholar.
                </p>

                    Sometimes, I <a href = "https://blog.liudaniel.com/">blog</a> about CS. For high school students who are interested in research, I have a <a href = "https://blog.liudaniel.com/high-school-research-opportunities">list</a> of opportunities I wish I'd known about when I started.
